pyfor
=================================

This is the documentation repository for **pyfor**, a Python package for point cloud data processing in the context of forest inventory.Our GitHub page is located `here <https://github.com/brycefrank/pyfor/tree/pdal-u>`_. Please refer to that page (specifically the Wiki) if you are interested in a "higher-level" user manual, installation instructions and the like.

However, if you are interested in nitty-gritty documentation of functions, this is the place to be. Consider this the last stop before reading source code.
